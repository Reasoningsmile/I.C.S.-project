As you approach the ruins you see that there isn't much left of them standing. At first as you walk
into the ruins you start to think that it may be a dead end, but then you notice an entrance that
leads underground. upon approaching the entrance skeleton warriors suddenly rise from the ground.

After vanquishing the skeletons you continue down into the dungeons under the ruins. You walk down
a short hallway that leads into a room that reminds you of the chapel, but more decrepit and less
holy. Rather than a pulpit there is an alter and a robed figure with their back to you. You hear
the robed figure call out, "I was wondering when someone was going to find me". The figure turns
around and you see a sinister grin painted across their face. They continue, "I was pretty certain
it would be an outsider that would come looking. The people of this quaint little village are a bit
stuck in their way. If anything changes they will continue on hoping it will go away. For myself, when
there is a new development one should take personal action". The robed figure raise their hand and it
starts glowing with green magical energy.

You lay on the ground battered fighting to raise yourself as the robed mage slowly walks toward the exit.
As they walk away they say, "that was quiet disappointing, you are certainly nothing like the heroes of
old. Now I have much more important things to do, I have finished my work here. Farewell, and if i see you
again I will kill you". As the robed mage leaves the dungeon your consciousness fades to black.
