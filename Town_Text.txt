#TOWN INTRO#
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As the wagon moves into the center of the village the coachman turns to you stating,"welcome the Knottwood
village,there are only a few amenities in this small village, but they should prove quite use-full to an
adventurer like yourself. There is the tavern, The Dancing Donkey, where you can get a nice ale or any gossip.
There's also an apothecary where you can replenish you stock of potions. Last but not least, there is the chapel.
The priest there can grant you a blessing to help heal what ever ails you. For myself I'm going to avail myself
of the tavern's room. Come day break tomorrow I'll be back on the road. I suggest you do the same if you're
keen on searching for the source of the dark rumors from this town. Goodbye adventurer, and good luck."
With that he turns with a wave, and heads off to the tavern leaving you in the center of the village.
You look around the town, noticing that the is little activity due to it being late. most places seem to be
closed for the evening.

#NIGHT#

You walk into the tavern and see several patrons enjoying food and drink spread around the main room.
There are several doors on the left side of the tavern, and a long counter along the right side with a
door to a kitchen.
The tavern owner is working behind the counter serving drinks and cleaning glasses.

You walk around the tavern trying to talk with the patrons, but they either make it clear they don't want
to chat with a stranger or ramble in a drunken stupor.

You walk up to the counter, and the tavern owner notices you approach. They call out to you, "hi there, it's
a surprise to see a stranger in town. What can I do for you, you can order some food and drink or rent a room?".

The owner asks, "Is there anything else I can do for you?"

You ask the tavern owner for a meal and drink. They say, "One meal and drink, that will be ten coin".
you hand over the coin and the tavern owner heads into the kitchen and a few minutes later comes out
with a bowl of stew and a tankard of ale. It's not the fancies meal you've eaten, but it still tastes
pretty good.

You ask the tavern owner if they know anymore about the dark rumors, and they answer,"well, some of the loggers
that operate in the forest north of town have mentioned seeing a cloaked figure right before the critters
started acting weird, there's not much more I can add other than that".

You ask the tavern owner for a room. They answer, "Sure thing, one room for one night will be twenty-five
coins". You hand over the coin, and they hand over a key. The tavern owner tells you, "Your room will be the
last room of the three". You head off to your room to get some rest.

#DAY#

You wake from your rest, gather your belonging and head out in to the center of the village. you should talk
around town about the rumors to gather information.

You walk into the building and see rows of shelves and cubbies filled with a variety of plants, fungi, a potions.
in the very back is a small counter with an individual in a leather apron working with their back turned to you,
they call out to you, "Don't be shy, come forth, and I'll see what I can do for you". You walk up to the counter
and the shop owner turns to you asking, "what can I do for you today?"

You ask the apothecary owner about the dark rumors, and they respond saying, "There's not much I can say with
certainty, but once when I was out gathering plants in the woods to the north, I can across some old ruins.
It's about in the area where the animals started acting up."

You walk into the small chapel, and before you are two sets of three pews, each on the other side of a narrow
aisle leading up to the pulpit. There are a few visitors spread out throughout the pews and a priest up at
the pulpit quietly reading from a large old tome.

You walk around the church speaking to each visitor in the pews. While they all are polite and answer your
questions you don't really gain any new information from them.

You head up the aisle and approach the pulpit. The priest looks up and smiles at you saying, "Good morning
my child, have you come for a blessing or is there something else I can do for you?"

You ask the priest if they can bless you. They close their book and responds with, "I will gladly give you a
blessing". They hold out their hand in your direction and start a slow, low chant. You suddenly feel a warm
comfort radiate from your chest and spread throughout your body. Your health has been restored.

You ask the priest if they know anything about the dark rumors. They tell you, "I've actually been
contemplating them a bit. While I don't know anything for certain, there is a bit of history that
seems like it maybe relevant. Many decades ago there was a cult that formed in the nearby area and
they grew to be a threat. Fortunately, a band of heroes was able to vanquish the cult and stop their
madness. Like I said, that was decades ago and not many remember them, but I can't help feeling like
they are somehow connected".

After gathering information around the village, you feel the ruins are the best route to continue investigating
the source of the dark magic. You take a northern path following the directions that the apothecary owner showed
you. About an hour after leaving the village you finally come across the ruins.
