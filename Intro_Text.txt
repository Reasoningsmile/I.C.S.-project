Your journey begins in the back of an old rickety wagon. As a new adventurer you where eager to prove
yourself, and the rumors of dark magics rising near as small village nestled in the mountain valleys
seemed an irresistible opportunity to pass up.
The day is growing long and the towering mountains make it seem even later due to them obscuring the sun.
As you ponder the risks of traveling in the dark the coachman looking over his shoulder states to you,
"we should be arriving to Knottwood village soon, with luck we should get there with no issue.
I'd rather not sleep without a roof and four walls around me again, so we will keep pushing on."
The coachman turns to you again asking, "by the way I know you're an adventurer,
but what is your vocation as an adventurer?"

"It's a good thing that you decided to head to the village the people there could really use someone
with your skills due to the increase of foul creatures in the area. I ..."
the coachman cuts of as his horses start kicking wildly.
"WWHHOOAA, there must be something in the woods spooking the horses."

"Well, you sure did a great job taking care of those wolves.", the driver says as he steps back up to
the box seat from the back of the wagon.
"Now lets hurry on to the village before any other critters try to attack us."
you climb back in the wagon, and the moment you sit on the bench the coachman urges on the horse at a
brisk pace.
Fortunately, the rest of the ride is uneventful and eventually arrive at the entrance of the village.
